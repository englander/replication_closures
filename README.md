## Data and Code Availability Statement

The paper uses public, non-confidential data from Peru's Ministry of Production (PRODUCE). The archive contains the data in the folder "Data/". The files from PRODUCE are BE_2017to2019_allvessels.xlsx, landings_2017to2019.xlsx, closures_2014to2019.xlsx, and owndf.csv. BE_2017to2019_allvessels.xlsx are the Bitácora Electrónica data for all vessels, landings_2017to2019.xlsx are the landings data for all vessels, closures_2014to2019.xslx are the temporary spatial closures that PRODUCE declared between 2014 and 2019, and owndf.csv are ownership information and vessel characteristics for all vessels.

The paper uses public, non-confidential data from Sociedad Nacional de Pesquería (SNP). The archive contains the data in the folder "Data/". The file from SNP is bedat_snp.csv. This file contains Bitácora Electrónica data for SNP vessels.

The paper uses public, non-confidential boundary data of Peru's Exclusive Economic Zone from the Flanders Marine Institute (Flanders Marine Institute, 2012). The archive contains the data in the folder "Data/Intersect_IHO_EEZ_v2_2012".

## Computational Requirements

-Software (version of R)
-Packages - There are many of them. They are all recorded in renv.lock file
-OS, CPU generation and quantity, memory and necessary disk space
	-Note that computers with fewer CPUs or less memory can run all analysis scripts, 
just not some of the Make Data scripts
-Wall clock-time. One estimate for Make Data scripts and another for analysis scripts


## Instructions for Data Preparation and Analysis

This should include separately instructions for data preparation and for analysis.
