Dependent variable is the inverse hyperbolic sine of millions of juveniles caught. All regressions estimate treatment effects for all 37 treatment bins, but only the coefficent on treatment fraction for the inside, day-before bin is displayed in this table. Standard errors clustered at level of two-week-of-sample by two-degree grid cell.}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \end{tabular}
