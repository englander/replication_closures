   \bottomrule \multicolumn{7}{l}{\multirow{2}{12cm}{Notes: All regressions have 33,024 observations. The unit of observation is a potential closure-treatment bin. For each potential closure-treatment bin, I calculate the distance to sets that occur during the period of the potential closure-treatment bin. The dependent variable is a quantile of these distances (in Column 4 it is the mean). All regressions control for the same variables as Equation 1, except instead of estimating 36 treatment coefficients these regressions estimate 1. Standard errors clustered at level of two-week-of-sample by two-degree grid cell.}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \end{tabular}
