Dependent variable is the inverse hyperbolic sine of millions of juveniles caught. All regressions include bin $+$ treatment fraction $\times$ bin variables for all bins, but only the coefficent on treatment fraction for the inside, day-before bin is displayed in this table. Standard errors clustered at level of two-week-of-sample by two-degree grid cell.}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \end{tabular}
